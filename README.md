Travel weather app.

This application will give a current and a 5 day forcast of the weather in a given city. The city will be saved in local storage and rendered underneath the search bar. The user can navigate back to any city by either clicking on the buttons or entering the city in the search bar again. The application also provides the UV index in the current weather section; there are four colors representing the severity of the UV index. Green is okay, yellow is warning, red is bad and black is severe.
